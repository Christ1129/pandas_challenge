PYCITYSCHOOLS REPORT

 After analyzing the PyCitySchool data, several considerations can be made, including the following:
- In general, the average success rates in mathematics are lower than those in reading 
- The budget of district schools is generally higher than that of charter schools (out 35), but as can be seen in the tables, the top 5 schools are all charter schools (out 22) while the bottom 5 are all district schools (out 23) .
- The results of the "Scores by School Spending" table (out 29) shows an inverse relationship between test scores and school budgets. Overall, schools with lower budgets performed better on tests. In contrast, schools with higher expenditures per student ($645-675) performed lower than schools with smaller budgets (<$585 per student).
- In terms of “grades by school size”, schools with more than 2,000 students have much lower pass rates than those with less than 2,000 students (out 32).
